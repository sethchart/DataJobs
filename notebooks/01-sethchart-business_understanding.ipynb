The official API [page](https://www.careerjet.com/partners/api/) for careerjet provides a python API package. Unfortunately, the official python package is not functional. There is an unofficial fork of the package that is functional that can be found [here](https://github.com/davebulaval/careerjet-api). \n",

For this reason, there are fairly restrictive rate limits for retrieving postings through the API. These limitations are not clearly documented, but they rendered the API unusable for large scale data collection.\n",

    "After discovering that the careerjet API would not be usable for data collection we investigated the possibility of scraping job postings by exploiting the page number url parameter to iterate over search result pages, scrape posting results from each result listing, then scrape each result url. However, after experimentation we discovered that the site only surfaces one hundred pages of search results with twenty postings per page.\n",
