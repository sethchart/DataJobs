# JobDash

## Business Understanding
The job market for the data industry can be difficult to navigate because there are a plethora of job titles and the relationship between titles and roles is often not well defined. Two identical roles may have completely different titles. Two substantially different roles may have the same title. This limits the usability of job titles as a means to succinctly communicate about data industry jobs. This project will directly analyze full job descriptions from a corpus of job postings to provide three main deliverables. First, a data driven classification of roles, where job classes distinguish between quantitatively different roles. Second, a tool for classifying a provided job description according to our scheme. Third, a comparison between our classification scheme and existing job titles ability to distinguish between roles. 

## Data Understanding
In order to produce our deliverables, we will need a sizable corpus of data industry job descriptions. We were able to obtain a corpus of approximately 9,700 job descriptions paired with their assigned job titles.
